Convolutional Neural Networks or CNN's.

There is so much to say about CNN's, where does one start? First of all else - neural networks in general attempt to replicate biological brain activities and functionalities. And CNN's, in particular, attempt to emulate biological vision - like in animals, and humans.

I will greatly expand on this, in the next few days.
